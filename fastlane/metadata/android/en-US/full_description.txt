It is an endless game where you play as an supernatural asteroid who is tired of the genocide caused by the spaceships from Earth and wants to destroy the planet by doing a kamikaze

Features :

	. Easy to start with minimal controls (just a joystick)
	. Very short play time (can be played easily between small breaks)
	. Open source
	. Fully free with no ads
	. Translations available in more than 25 languages

Made with (guess the engine- it is present among the top 3 engines with the most projects on itch.io)

This is just a idea i had after watching way too many games where player spaceships shoot down harmless asteroids. I thought about them getting revenge and decided to make a game on it.
