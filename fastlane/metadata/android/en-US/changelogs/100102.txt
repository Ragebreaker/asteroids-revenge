v0.11.0 Changes

- Updated godot version to 4.3
- Added a new control scheme (should be enabled by you in settings) as the old one was kinda hard to use 
- As suggested by [lealternativeto.net](https://www.lealternative.net/), the new controls have the player moving automatically down for android only (touch left/right side of screen to move to side)
- Added info regarding the new controls in the help section
- The fire button now reacts to user input like the home screen buttons instead of just performing the action
